# NTFLX Auto-Skip

Do you want to binge-watch sometimes or are you fed up with having to wake up and click the "skip" buttons when you are away from your computer? Fear not! NTFLX Auto-Skip is here to click these buttons for you. Now you can sit back and enjoy your favorite show in peace! 


## Features

- [x] Skip the summaries 
- [x] Skip the introductions 
- [x] Instantly play the next episode 
- [x] Ignore the "Are you still watching?" message 
- [x] Allow the user to de.activate any of the features above 


## How to use?

Once installed, all you have to do is to select what you want to skip automatically: 
- **All**: toggle all other options below
- **Summaries**: to skip the recaps
- **Introductions**: to skip the intros
- **Next episode**: to skip to the next episode without waiting for the 5 seconds timer
- **Still watching?**: to ignore the dialog box asking if you are still watching 

You may need to restart your Netflix page the first time you install the extension. After that, it remembers your choices on all your devices if you are logged into your browser. When watching a show, the extension lets you know when something is skipped. 


## Cross-browser..ish?

Exactly, it should work on popular browsers like Firefox (min 45.0), Edge and Chrome. To make it work in Chrome, you need to replace the main script and the manifest with their chrome versions. I tested in Firefox and Chrome, works perfectly.
